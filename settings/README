settings module is organized so that there is global settings for all projects and project
settings for each specific project.

- global settings are updated by django-boilerplate itself
- project settings are updated by each specific project itself

The hierarchy structure:

- settings.common > project.common -> settings.dev -> project.dev
- settings.common -> project.common -> settings.prod -> project.prod
- settings.common -> project.common -> settings.stag -> project.stag

project.common is used to override settings.common
project.dev is used to override settings.dev
project.prod is used to override settings.prod
project.stag is used to override settings.stag

dev, prod and stag are settings for development, production and staging environment respectively
