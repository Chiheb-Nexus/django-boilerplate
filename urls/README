urls module is organized so that there is global urls for all projects and project
urls for each specific project.

- global urls are updated by django-boilerplate itself
- project urls are updated by each specific project itself

The hierarchy structure:

- urls.common > project.common -> urls.dev -> project.dev
- urls.common -> project.common -> urls.prod -> project.prod
- urls.common -> project.common -> urls.stag -> project.stag

project.common is used to override urls.common
project.dev is used to override urls.dev
project.prod is used to override urls.prod
project.stag is used to override urls.stag

dev, prod and stag are settings for development, production and staging environment respectively
