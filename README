=== How to start develop ===

1. Create a virtual environment by installing virtualenvwrapper here: http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
2. Clone this repository to your `workon` virtual environment
3. Install dev dependency requirements with this command: `pip install requirements/dev.txt`
4. Syncdb with: `python manage.py syncdb` and start the server with `python manage.py runserver`.

It's time having fun for developing cool apps :).
